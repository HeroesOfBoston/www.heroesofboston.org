The hero in the cowboy hat.

[Carlos Arredondo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Arredondo) was at the Boston Marathon to support [Tough Ruck](http://www.militaryfriends.org/partnerships/tough-ruck/) runners that were running as a memorial to falled soldiers.

Carlos helped rescue Jeff Bauman Jr. by applying a make-shift tourniquet to his legs from a sweater he found.
