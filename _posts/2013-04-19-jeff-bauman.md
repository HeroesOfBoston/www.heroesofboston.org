Jeff Bauman, 27, lost both legs in the first bomb attack at the Boston Marathon.  He was                                            
rescued, in part, by <a href="/heroes/2013/04/17/carlos-arredondo/">Carlos Arredondo</a>.

Bloomberg reports that Bauman not only held onto his memory of the incident through his
intense trauma, but that the very first thing he did upon waking in the hospital was
recount the image of the man who left a backpack at his feet for the FBI.  Bauman described
a man wearing a black baseball hat and jacket over a hooded sweatshirt. Bauman’s description
helped lead the FBI to identify the surviving bomb suspect from last night’s shootout as
19-year-old Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev of Chechnya. [1]
