# HeroesOfBoston

A static site honoring the heroes of the Boston Marathon attack.

*Why?*

We all need to do our part to help out.  This will hopefully preserve the memory of a city coming together in crisis.

*Who are the heroes?*

Heroes include any person or group that responded in a time of crisis.  For example a hero is:

- a person or group that helped the injured
- a person or group that helped the runners/spectators
- officials responding to the scene
- officials tracing the evidence and searching for the suspects
- a person or group reporting facts as they happen (i.e. reddit)
- a person or group providing relief efforts (i.e. fundraising)
